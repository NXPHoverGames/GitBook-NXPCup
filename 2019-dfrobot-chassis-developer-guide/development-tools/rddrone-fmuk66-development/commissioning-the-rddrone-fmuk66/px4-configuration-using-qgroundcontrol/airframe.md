# Airframe

In the _airframe_ screen, under the _Rover_ configurations, select the _Generic Ground Vehicle_ airframe preset. The QGroundControl user guide provides more information on how you can select this airframe.

{% hint style="info" %}
As of 1/22/21, PX4 and QGroundControl now have an option for the NXP Cup Rover when setting up the "Airframe". Instead of Generic Ground Vehicle as pictured below, use the drop-down menu and select the NXP Cup Rover airframe.
{% endhint %}
