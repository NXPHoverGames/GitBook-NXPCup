## Welcome to NXP Cup

This Gitbook helps you quick start into the NXP CUP. It contains information on hardware i.e. recommendations, documentation and assembly support. And Software like basic source code and commands.

**More hardware options:** In season 2019/20 the hardware setups will be more diverse. By default there will be [two car chassis](https://community.nxp.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/1091-27-456210/NXPCUP\_Car+Introduction.pdf) configurations by **DFRobot**. These chassis support **brushed** AND **brushless motors** for the first time ever in NXP CUP EMEA.

Moreover there are two new MCUs. First, a board developed entirely for this competition - the "**ARC-Board**" also named "Micro E Board". This board was developed by students and professors of the "Haute-Ecole Arc" in Switzerland and is finally available for every participant. It supports brushed motors and a camera communicating via SPI\*\*.\*\* The Second board is the [**RDDRONE-FMUK66**](https://www.nxp.com/applications/solutions/industrial/unmanned-aerial-vehicles-uavs/uavs-drones-and-rovers/rddrone-fmuk66-px4-robotic-drone-fmu-reference-design:RDDRONE-FMUK66?\&tid=vanRDDRONE-FMUK66) which is also a part of the [Hovergames drone](https://nxp.gitbook.io/hovergames/). NXP CUP proofs that this particular flight controller is ready to steer rovers too!\
Finally we introduce an intelligent camera into the Cup, the **Pixy 2 camera**. This camera has its own MCU and does line tracking or colored block detection by itself. The Pixy 2 can communicate via I2C, SPI and UART.

All these components and configurations are described in this documentation. The default setup is the DFRobot chassis with brushed motors, the Micro E board and the Pixy 2 OR DFRobot chassis with brushless motors, RDDRONE-FMUK66 and Pixy 2. You pick!

Students have the option of using setups from the past seasons or other NXP MCU boards. But these are not supported in this documentation.
