# Assembly

First of all, you have to do the assembly of the car. Each step is described thoroughly and pictures are provided. Before you start building the car, make sure to check the kit contents! A list of components you may find [here](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/developer-guide/getting-started/rover-kits-contents). The Assembly of the car includes mounting the camera and fixing the MCU. 

Then choose your MCU: [Micro E Board](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/developer-guide/assembly/using-the-arc-board) \(ARC Board\) or [FMU](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/developer-guide/assembly/rddrone-fmuk66).
