## Task 1: Build Pixy Camera mount

Gather the Pixy mount and mounting hardware baggy.

The two plastic pieces may be a tight fit initially. Wiggling them back and forth gently while assembling will help them go together.

The nut goes in the side that has a hole cut out for it. Thread the screw through the nut and tighten it down so that there is friction between the parts. This will keep the arm sturdy.

Once the main nut and bolt are installed, take out the other mounting hardware from the baggy (3 screws and 3 nuts). We will mount this to the front of the top PCB.
