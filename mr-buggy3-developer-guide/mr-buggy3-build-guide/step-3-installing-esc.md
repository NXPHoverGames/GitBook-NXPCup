# Step 3: Installing ESC

## Task 1: Apply tape to ESC

The replacement ESC is supplied separately and will look something like this:

{% hint style="info" %}
The power connector on your ESC may be this Yellow "XT60"" type or a reddish "DEANS"  T-type connector. Either one will work.

Note also - Most off the shelf Brushed ESCs in the approx 40A range should also work.
{% endhint %}

Locate the strip of double-sided foam tape included in the kit. On the bottom side of the ESC, place two stacks of tape on the side closest to the blue and yellow wires, while placing 5 stacks of tape to the other side, like so:

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to remove the paper cover from each square of tape before stacking.
{% endhint %}

## Task 2: Install ESC

Once you've done this, you can mount the ESC to the buggy. Place it where the old radio controlled ESC was, but make sure to allow room to tuck the wires. Face the side with only two stacks of tape closest to the outside edge of the buggy frame.

## Task 3: Plug motor into ESC

Next, connect the wires to the motor. The yellow wire goes to the red wire on the motor, while the blue goes to the black wire. The connectors on the ESC side are different, but the motor side should fit into one of the holes for the ESC connectors.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If these wires are reversed it will not damage the motor, but the motor will run backward to what is expected.
{% endhint %}

Tuck the wires between the ESC and the motor.

## Task 4: Mount ESC power switch

Apply some double sided tape to the ESC power switch and mount it to the mid-plate of the buggy.
