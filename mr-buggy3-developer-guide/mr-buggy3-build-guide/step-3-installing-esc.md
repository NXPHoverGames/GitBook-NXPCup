# Step 3: Installing ESC

## Task 1: Apply tape to ESC

Our new ESC looks like this:

You will also want to get out the strip of double-sided foam tape we included in the kit. On the bottom side of the ESC, place two stacks of tape on the side closest to the blue and yellow wires, while placing 5 stacks of tape to the other side, like so:

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to remove the paper cover from each square of tape before stacking.
{% endhint %}

## Task 2: Install ESC

Once you've done this, you can mount the ESC to the buggy. Place it where the old radio controlled ESC was, but make sure to give some room to tuck the wires. Have the side with two stacks of tape closest to the edge.

## Task 3: Plug motor into ESC

Next, connect the wires to the motor. The yellow wire goes to the red wire on the motor, while the blue goes to the black wire. The connectors on the ESC side are different, but the motor side should fit into one of the holes for the ESC connectors.

Tuck the wires between the ESC and the motor.

## Task 4: Mount ESC power switch

Apply some double sided tape to the ESC power switch and mount it to the midplate of the buggy.
