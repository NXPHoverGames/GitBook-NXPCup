# Step 10: Installing the RC receiver

The FlySky i-6S radio controller will be helpful for developing and troubleshooting your buggy. It will also allow you to drive it manually if you want to have a bit of fun with it outside of NXP Cup!

Gather the FlySky i-6S radio controller package and unpack it.

We won't need the two baggies on the left - you can put those away. We are really focusing on the baggy on the right - the RC receiver.

{% hint style="info" %}
The extra components provided in the center bag allow for spring loading the joystick which may be desirable in some instances.
{% endhint %}

Take the receiver out, and grab the double sided tape from the ESC bag - it should be a rounded rectangle with red covering tape.

You will also need the 3-prong to JST-GH connector for the receiver, shown in the picture below.

The images below all show the 3 pin receiver connector installed in reverse.\
The white wire should be toward the outside.\
TODO- take new pictures and update.

<mark style="color:blue;">Note the above (blue) picture shows the correct orientation of the RC cable wiring.</mark>

Place the tape on the back of the receiver and place the receiver on the back of the top PCB.

{% hint style="success" %}
The antennas can be positioned in a variety of ways. You may wish to 3d print a mount for them, or use the oval holes on the edges of the PCB to zip tie them upward. Facing them upright will result in better range.
{% endhint %}

Plug the receiver into the FMU through the RC IN port.

Next we will connect the wires for the battery, FMU power, and PWM!
