# Step 10: Installing the RC receiver

The FlySky i-6S radio controller will be helpful for developing and troubleshooting your buggy. It will also allow you to drive it manually if you want to have a bit of fun with it outside of NXP Cup!

Gather the FlySky i-6S radio controller package and unpack it.

We won't need the two baggies on the left - you can put those away. We are really focusing on the baggy on the right - the RC receiver.

Take the receiver out, and grab the double sided tape from the ESC bag - it should be a rounded rectangle with red covering tape.

You will also need the 3-prong to JST-GH connector for the receiver, shown in the picture below.

Place the tape on the back of the receiver and place the receiver on the back of the top PCB.

Plug the receiver into the FMU through the RC IN port.

Next we will connect the wires for the battery, FMU power, and PWM!
