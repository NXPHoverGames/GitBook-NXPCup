# Step 4: Installing PDB

## Task 1: Attach PDB to front mount

Locate the PDB and front shock tower mount as shown below:

You should use four M2.5x5mm screws to mount the PDB to the front mount.

{% hint style="danger" %}
On early 2022 kits, the front mount may have incorrectly sized screw holes. We suggest using some of the M3 screws from the nylon screw/spacer kit that was included in the buggy box. It may take a bit of force to get them to thread initially, but they should hold much better than the M2.5x5mm screws.&#x20;

Alternatively some white glue will also hold the existing screws in place. \


YMMV. If you have issues with this step and need help, please contact us in the Discord server support channel.

The front mount assembly is completed. You may move on to task 2.

## Task 2: Install front mount to front shock tower

Find the M2.5x10mm screws to install the front mount.

The front mount should slide over the front shock tower. Use the two screws to secure the front mount like so:

## Task 3: Plug in ESC

Now you can plug in the ESC to the PDB. It goes in the middle XT60 connector.
