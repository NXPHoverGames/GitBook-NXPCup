# Step 2: Installing new Servo

## Task 1: Remove existing servo

The existing original steering servo on the buggy does not have the proper interface connector to work the FMU. It needs to be swapped for one that uses traditional RC 3-Wire PWM. To remove the existing servo, first we must unfasten it from the base of the buggy. There are two screws on the bottom, and you can see two small locking pins next to them which keeps the plastic mount in place. Remove these two screws like so:

Once these screws have been removed,  the servo can be lifted out of its mounting bracket. \
The next step is to remove the steering crown from the servo. Remove the crown by unscrewing the single set screw in the middle:

Next, transfer the servo mounting bracket to the new servo.

You will not need any of the hardware included in the baggy with the JX servo.

## Task 2: Install new servo

Attach the crown to the new servo. Make sure that it is facing straight up. Do not turn the servo or it will require calibration upon booting up the PX4 system.

Also make sure that the front wheels are pointing straight! There is a bit of outward toe by default, just try to get it as straight as possible.
{% endhint %}

The set screw from the previous servo will not work as the previous servo had a plastic housing. You will need to use a screw from the extra screw kit included in your box. The screw will be in the middle right bin of the kit.

XXX NOTE TO LANDON XXX - While this screw likely works fine work, I understood there should be a separate socket head cap screw (Silver or Black) that was purchased specifically for this purpose. Need to double check in the BOM.

Screw in the set screw and try not to tighten it too tight. If the horn twists, return it to the upright position.

Place the servo back in the slot and screw it back in.

Once you have mounted the servo back to the base of the buggy, you may continue to the next step.
