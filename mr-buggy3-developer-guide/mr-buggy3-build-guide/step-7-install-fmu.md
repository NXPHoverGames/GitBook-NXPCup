## Task 2: Put together shock mount for FMU

Gather the carbon-fiber plate and blue rubber grommets for the FMU mount.

Push a grommet through each of the 4 corners. We recommend using the flathead screwdriver from the kit to do so. These grommets are quite resilient, so you can use some force to get them in.

## Task 3: Install shock mount to top PCB

Attach the shock mount to the other PCB like so:

## Task 4: Install FMU to mount

Next, use 4 squars of double sided foam tape and apply them to the corners of the shock mount.

Then, attach the FMU in the orientation shown below. Make sure that the FMU is pointing directly towards the front of the PCB.
