The nut goes in the side that has a hole cut out for it. Thread the screw through the nut and tighten it down so that there is friction between the parts. This will keep the arm sturdy.

Once you've done this, take out the other mounting hardware from the baggy (3 screws and 3 nuts). We will mount this to the front of the top PCB.
