# Getting started

## Welcome to the new MR-Buggy3 Chassis

For the NXP Cup 2022 season, we are introducing a new chassis called MR-Buggy3. This chassis is built on top of a WLToys 144001 chassis. The MR-Buggy3 chassis is modified for the NXP Cup and HoverGames competitions with our Mobile Robotics suite of components such as the RDDRONE-FMUK66, NavQ+, UCANS32K146, T1ETH, and more.

Please continue to the next page to begin the MR-Buggy3 build.
