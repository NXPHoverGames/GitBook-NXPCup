# Introduction - Why Gazebo

DRAFT  
Gazebo is a simulation environment and optional to use with NXP CUP. The benefit is that you get a virtual car that cant crash and be broken, but it runs almost exactly the same software.  
  
To run Gazebo you will need an Ubuntu Linux environment or virtual machine. This aspect isn't covered here, as you can find that online. We do have a information on using a virtual machine with PX4 here : &lt;todo -add link to hovergames VM&gt;
