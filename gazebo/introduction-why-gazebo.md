# Introduction to NXP Gazebo Summer Camp

## Introduction

Welcome to the NXP Gazebo Summer Camp! This event is designed to familiarize NXP Cup participants with the NXP Gazebo simulation environment for NXP Cup. The simulation environment will allow NXP Cup contestants to design, prototype, and test their NXP Cup software in a rapid fashion without the risk of damaging their NXP Cup cars.&#x20;

This Gitbook contains all of the necessary documentation for installing, running, and building your NXP Cup car in NXP Gazebo. Use the context menus on the left to go through each section of the guide.

For information on System Requirements, Milestones, and more, read below!

## What's Gazebo?

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1) (1).png>)

Gazebo is a full-fledged simulation environment built on top of ROS. In 2021, NXP Cup contestants may use the Gazebo simulation for an extra challenge at home. The benefit to using the Gazebo simulation environment is that you can test your code without crashing or damaging your actual NXP Cup car. The code modules that you run on your actual NXP Cup car can be ported to the Gazebo simulation environment (and vice versa) with ease.

## Can I run NXP Gazebo?

See the minimum and recommended system requirements below to see if you can run NXP Gazebo.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you run NXP Gazebo in a native Ubuntu installation! Virtual Machine performance can vary greatly from machine to machine and can produce inconsistent simulation results!
{% endhint %}

Minimum Requirements:

* **CPU**: Quad-core Intel or AMD mobile processor or better (i.e. Intel i5-8550U or AMD Ryzen 5 3500U)
* **GPU**: Intel UHD Graphics or better
* **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04
* **RAM**: 8GB (Native Ubuntu) / 16GB (Virtual Machine)
* **Storage**: 50GB (SSD highly recommended)

Recommended Requirements:

* **CPU**: Quad-core Intel or AMD desktop processor or better (i.e. Intel i5-9400F or AMD Ryzen 5 2600)
* **GPU**: Dedicated Nvidia or AMD GPU (i.e. Nvidia GTX 1060 or AMD RX 480)
* **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04
* **RAM**: 16GB (Native Ubuntu)
* **Storage**: 50GB (SSD highly recommended)

## Milestones

Throughout the NXP Gazebo Summer Camp, contestants will be required to meet four milestones within simulation. The milestones are as follows:

### Milestone 1 - Intro to NXP Gazebo and ROS

1. Obtain learning materials, documentation, videos, and more!
2. Learn about Gazebo, ROS, and the NXP Gazebo environment
3. Install and run the NXP Gazebo simulation

### Milestone 2 - Time to go fast!

1. Drive around the track successfully using the example code
2. Write your own self-driving algorithm and improve upon the example! See how fast you can go!

### Milestone 3 - Simple reaction

1. Stop at a stop sign for 3 seconds and then continue
2. Avoid a stationary object obstructing the track

### Milestone 4 - Advanced reaction

1. Recognize a 4-way intersection and turn right
2. Recognize a moving object crossing the track and wait for it to cross

## How do I start?

Continue to the next section to start installing the required software for the Gazebo simulation environment. Soon you will be running the environment shown below!
