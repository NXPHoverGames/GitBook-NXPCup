# Programming the RDDRONE-FMUK66

First, the FMU has to be prepared for the [first use](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/developer-guide/development-tools/rddrone-fmuk66-development/commissioning-the-rddrone-fmuk66/programming-fmuk66-for-first-use). Then a general way to [program software using debugging](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/developer-guide/development-tools/rddrone-fmuk66-development/commissioning-the-rddrone-fmuk66/program-software-using-debugger) is shown. Because of it's drone origin the FMU has to be configured with QgroundControl, a ground station for drones. It might not be necessary to do the configuration in QGroundControl but can provide some random errors. So the [PX4 configuration with QGroundControl](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/developer-guide/development-tools/rddrone-fmuk66-development/commissioning-the-rddrone-fmuk66/px4-configuration-using-qgroundcontrol) is shown in this section.

Last but not least, there will be an example application for the NXP Cup race and [here](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup/developer-guide/development-tools/rddrone-fmuk66-development/commissioning-the-rddrone-fmuk66/the-example-application) will be shown how to include this application and how to work with it.
