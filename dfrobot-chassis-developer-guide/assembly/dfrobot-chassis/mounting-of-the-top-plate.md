# Rear wheels and top plate

## Mounting of motors and rear axles

This chassis has two rear axles for implementing a differential in software. Thus you have to screw on an axle bracket in the rear area. You need two M3x6 screws and the axle mount. Screw them to the two round holes at the mid-back.

Regardless of whether ESCs have been used or not, the motors are installed as follows:

If not already done, put the small white gear wheels onto to motor axles.

Mounting the motors requires two M3x6 screws per motor. At each side of the chassis are a big oval hole enclosed from two smaller oval holes. Guide the motor axis through the larger hole and fix the motor with the screws over the two smaller holes.

First guide an axis through the outer ball bearing. Before you put the axle through the second ball bearing, put the retaining ring on the axle. Screw a hub screw slightly onto the retaining ring. Do not tighten the screw completely yet. Repeat for the second axis.

## Preparing the rear gear wheels

For the following steps you need the bit white gear wheels, two flanges, eight M3x6 screws and four hub screws.

Put the flanges through the wholes of the gears and fix them with four M3x6 screws per gear.  Screw two hub screws per flange slightly onto the flange but do not tighten the screws completely yet.

Put the gears onto the axles as shown in the picture below. Means the black flange has directly contact to the lower plate. Fix the hub screws of the flanges and the retaining rings. Make sure that the retaining ring and flange fix the axle to the lower plate so that the axle cannot slip.&#x20;

It may be necessary to adjust the motor so that the big and the small gear fit. Make sure that a very small gap is between the both gears, but the motor can drives the gear.

## Affixing the brass wheel couplers

{% hint style="warning" %}
The brass couplers do not come with two retention screws. Your wheels will be off balance without two retention screws. We suggest using the retention screws from the PixyCam mount to fill in the two open retention screw slots on the brass couplers. You can use super glue to affix the rod to the base for the PixyCam mount.
{% endhint %}

Now put brass colored coupling onto the axis and add the retention screws. In the best case fix each coupling with two hub screws, but in the kit are only one hub screw per coupling.

## Mounting the rear wheels

Put the wheels onto the couplings and fix them with one M4x10 screw per wheel.

## Installing the bumpers

### Back bumper

The assembly includes two bumpers , one in the front and one in the back. You need two M3x6 screws, two copper columns (M3x15 double pass), two plastic columns and one bumper per side. First, tighten the copper colums with two M3x6 screws as two pictures below. Than, push the white plastic columns onto the copper columns. A little force may be required.

Now the bumper can be stick onto the plastic columns.

The back bumper will be fixed with a washer and a M3x20 single head copper column per hole.

### Front bumper

The first steps for the front bumper are similar to the back bumper assembly. Fix the M3x15 double pass copper columns with two M3x6 screws to the front. Use the outer holes. now stick the plastic columns onto the copper columns and than put the bumper on the columns.

The front bumper is fixed with two washers and two M3x6 screws as shown in the picture below.

## Mounting the middle double pass columns

In the middle of the chassis two M3x45 double pass copper columns have to be installed. Fix them with one M3x6 screw per side as shown in the both pictures below.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/20191217\_160836.jpg)

## Mounting the top plate

Last but not least the top plate can be fixed to the chassis with six M3x6 screws. Compare with the pictures below.

This is the end of the general mounting. Depending on the board that is to be used, something else may need to be mounted or added.&#x20;

For mounting the FMU go to:

For mounting the Micro E board go to:

The next chapter shows how to mount the camera pole and the Pixy2 camera. This is used independently of the kind of board.
