The NXP RDDRONE-FMUK66 flight management unit is the brain of the HoverGames drone but also can be used for rovers. It features NXP sensors and automotive grade components and it is fully supported by [PX4 Autopilot software](https://docs.px4.io/en/). This GitBook provides instructions and external sources which should help you set up the software.

The FMU comes with a 3D printed enclosure, which can be mounted on top of the drone with double-sided tape. A microSD card is also included.
