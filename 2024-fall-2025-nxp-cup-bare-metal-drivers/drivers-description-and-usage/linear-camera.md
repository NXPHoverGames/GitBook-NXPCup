# Linear camera

The Linear camera driver is suitable for 128x1 cameras. It sends the clock and shutter signals to the camera and stores the analog values in an array.

Note: The driver does not provide a function to get the values. Instead, you should declare the buffer as an extern variable like in the example to get the values directly from the driver.

#### Initialization

```c
void LinearCameraInit(Pwm_ChannelType ClkPwmChannel, Gpt_ChannelType ShutterGptChannel, Adc_GroupType InputAdcGroup, Dio_ChannelType ShutterDioChannel);
```

Parameters:

路       ClkPwmChannel: The Pwm channel configured for the camera in the Peripherals tool.

路       ShutterPwmChannel: The Pwm channel configured for the camera in the Peripherals tool.

路       InputAdcGroup: The Adc Group configured for the camera in the Peripherals tool.

#### Getting a frame

```c
void LinearCameraGetFrame(LinearCameraFrame *Frame);
```

Parameter:

路       Frame: The address of the variable where to store the analog values. The buffer must be declared by the user.

#### Relevant structures

```c
typedef struct{
    Pwm_ChannelType ClkPwmChannel;
    Gpt_ChannelType ShutterGptChannel;
    Adc_GroupType InputAdcGroup;
    Dio_ChannelType ShutterDioChannel;
    uint16 CurrentIndex;
    LinearCameraFrame *BufferReference;
}LinearCamera;
```

```c
typedef struct{
	uint8 Values[128];
}LinearCameraFrame;
```
