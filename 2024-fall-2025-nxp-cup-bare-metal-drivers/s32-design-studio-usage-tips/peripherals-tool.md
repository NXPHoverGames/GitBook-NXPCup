# Peripherals tool

The Peripherals tool is where you do the initial setup of all the RTD drivers. Here you can configure everything from pins to communication channels.&#x20;

This tool is designed to assist us by allowing peripheral configuration without manually accessing registers or manipulating bits. Let's take a look at an example.&#x20;

Here, you can configure how the UART will operate. You can set the desired baud rate, choose the method for asynchronous communication (either interrupts or DMA), and select the clock source for the peripheral, among other options. Additionally, you can specify which hardware channel to use, which refers to the pins assigned for UART communication.
