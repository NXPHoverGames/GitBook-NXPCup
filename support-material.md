# Support Material

We have gathered different course material from different professors in the EMEA region. These tools provide a quick start for working with the Alamak Car, Model C and the FRDM board. Plus, below documentation gives a good overview of the NXP CUP. Thank's a lot to the professors that provided the material for the community!
